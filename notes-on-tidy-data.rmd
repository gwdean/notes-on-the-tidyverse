This document is written to help me understand the contents in Hadley Wickham's 2014 paper "Tidy Data" from the _Journal of Statistical Software_. It is intended to be an informal summary/commentary that will help me get at the main essence of the work. In addition, it will serve as a way to practice using RStudio and Github as a preparation for my upcoming presentation at UMass Dartmouth.

## High Level Overview of the Document
The first step in understanding a paper such as this is to gain a high-level overview of the structure of the document. The version I have can be found at the following link:

https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf

Looks like a final pre-print, as there is no date listed. The website for the _Journal of Statistical Software_ can be found here:

https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf

The document itself is 22 pages long, with an additional page of 15 references. The paper consists of an abstract, and seven sections. The seventh section is simply an acknowledgment of the people that Wickham worked with while developing the ideas in the paper, so the core of the paper is the first six sections, which we we list here:

1. Introduction (1-2)
2. Defining tidy data (2-5)
3. Tidying messy data sets (5-13)
4. Tidy tools (13-16)
5. Case Study (16-20)
6. Discussion (20-22)

Below I will boil each of these sections down as far as I can to extract the key points.

## Introduction

## Defining tidy data

## Tidying messy data sets

## Tidy tools

## Case Study

## Discussion








```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
