This document is written to help me understand the contents in Hadley
Wickham’s 2014 paper “Tidy Data” from the *Journal of Statistical
Software*. It is intended to be an informal summary/commentary that will
help me get at the main essence of the work. In addition, it will serve
as a way to practice using RStudio and Github as a preparation for my
upcoming presentation at UMass Dartmouth.

## High Level Overview of the Document

The first step in understanding a paper such as this is to gain a
high-level overview of the structure of the document. The version I have
can be found at the following link:

<https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf>

Looks like a final pre-print, as there is no date listed. The website
for the *Journal of Statistical Software* can be found here:

The document itself is 22 pages long, with an additional page of 15
references. The paper consists of an abstract, and seven sections. The
seventh section is simply an acknowledgment of the people that Wickham
worked with while developing the ideas in the paper, so the core of the
paper is the first six sections, which we we list here:

1.  Introduction (1-2)
2.  Defining tidy data (2-5)
3.  Tidying messy data sets (5-13)
4.  Tidy tools (13-16)
5.  Case Study (16-20)
6.  Discussion (20-22)

Below I will boil each of these sections down as far as I can to extract
the key points.
